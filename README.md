Math swimming is a game where math and swim are combined. 
To play math-swimming, you'll have to start, select a gamemode, and a difficulty (Only easy difficulties are done).
Once done all of the previous steps (using the mouse of course) on your screen will appear a swimmer, this swimmer is controlled by the arrow keys, but in this game, you can only control the swimmer by the x-axis.
Your objective in the speedrun mode, is to collect all the powerups possible, wich increases your speed, and answer all of the math questions correctly (by colliding with the math question block). If you do so, you'll reduce your final time by a lot. 
Nevertheless, you have to avoid all of the obstacles and enemies, because if you collide with them, you'll lose your speed.
Your objective in the points mania mode is to collect as many coins as possible, so that your score bar is at the highest possible. Answering correctly math questions will add points to your score bar. But same as the speedrun mode, 
if you collide with obstacles or enemies, in this case you'll lose points. Remember, you only got 60 seconds to collect as many points as you can.

As you can see, this is a very simple game, although is not finished. I'll keep working and try to finish the game as soon as I can. 
If you see any changes that can make the game more efficient or more fun, please tell me, i'll look into it.

That's it for the lecture, hope you enjoy it!
